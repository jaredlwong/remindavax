Remindavax is an mHealth social enterprise currently operating in twelve primary health centers and serving over 3,300 pregnant women, mothers, and community health workers in rural Karnataka, India, with SMS reminders for antenatal care check-ups and infant vaccinations. Early impact assessment indicates a 10% increase in rates of the third vaccination dose of three doses administered. Remindavax is now focusing on publishing research on the effectiveness of the pilot, expanding use of the SMS reminder system, which includes a basic electronic medical records system, and expanding to interactive 2-way SMS messages to improve treatment adherence, patient follow-up after hospital discharge, and appointment attendance. We are also building smartphone application versions of this interactive response system for Android and iPhone.

Remindavax aims to improve healthcare and health outcomes locally, nationally, and globally by addressing the enormous problems of treatment failures and resistance, hospital readmissions, and missed appointments with an extremely low-cost, low-maintenance system. Our two-way SMS message system will improve adherence to treatments for conditions as diverse as tuberculosis and hypertension, thereby helping to prevent deaths, drug resistance, and unnecessary operations and costs.
